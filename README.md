# Personal Portfolio Back-end
This is my personal portfolio backend. This project uses NodeJS and ExpressJS to provide an API endpoint for my portfolio website hosted in Heroku!
## Getting Started
The source can be retrieved from Github.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stephendpmurphy/portfolio_backend.git
```

To begin, we need to first install the project Node dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```

Once we have our dependencies, we can start up our API server on a local host. Nodemon is also ran which allows live-reloading of the server when any changes are made.
```bash
$ npm dev
```

To start the API server without nodemon, you can use the start script.
```bash
$ npm start
```
