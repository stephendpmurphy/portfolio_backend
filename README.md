# Personal Portfolio Back-end
This is my personal portfolio! This project acts as a means of displaying my skills and current projects to the world and to also practice and learn new concepts in Web design! This project uses HTML, JS and SASS. No front-end framework business just yet since I wanted to really learn and hone my Vanilla JS skillz.

## Getting Started
The source can be retrieved from Github.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stephendpmurphy/portfolio_backend.git
```

To begin, we need to first install the project Node dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```

Once we have our dependencies, we can start up our API server on a local host. Nodemon is also ran which allows live-reloading of the server when any changes are made.
```bash
$ npm dev
```

To start the API server without nodemon, you can use the start script.
```bash
$ npm start
```
